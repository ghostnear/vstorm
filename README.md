# VStorm

### A simple app framework for V based on nodes.

Currently in early development.

## How to install

The simplest way to install and use with your V installation is from VPM using:

> v install ghostnear.vstorm

Then the library will be available for importing using:

> import vstorm

An alternative way to do this is by adding the repo as a submodule in your modules/ folder using GitHub.

## How to use

Everything is documented in the docs/ folder.

Depending on your intent you might want to check out the [dev](docs/dev.md) documentation or the [user](docs/user.md) one.

## Known issues and TODOs:

- fix the multiply and divide function for NodeV2D
